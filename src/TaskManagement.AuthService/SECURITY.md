# Auth Service Security Documentation

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. JWT Token Security
- **Enhanced Validation**: Added comprehensive null checks and validation for JWT settings at startup
- **Improved Token Claims**: Added JWT ID (jti) and issued at (iat) claims for better token tracking
- **Secure Key Encoding**: Changed from ASCII to UTF-8 encoding for better security
- **Token Metadata**: Added NotBefore and IssuedAt timestamps for precise token validation

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Stronger Password Requirements**: 
  - Minimum 8 characters (increased from 6)
  - Must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- **XSS Prevention**: Added input sanitization to remove HTML tags and potentially harmful characters
- **Email Normalization**: Consistent email normalization and validation

### 3. Configuration Security
- **Startup Validation**: Added validation of critical configuration at application startup
- **JWT Secret Key**: Updated placeholder to indicate production requirements
- **Environment-based Configuration**: Support for environment-specific settings

### 4. CORS Security
- **Environment-based CORS**: Restrictive CORS policy for production, permissive for development
- **Configurable Origins**: CORS origins configurable via appsettings
- **Credential Support**: Added support for credentials in CORS policy

### 5. Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy**: Basic CSP to prevent XSS attacks
- **Frame Options**: Prevent clickjacking with X-Frame-Options: DENY
- **Content Type Options**: Prevent MIME type sniffing
- **XSS Protection**: Enable browser XSS protection
- **Referrer Policy**: Control referrer information leakage
- **Server Header Removal**: Remove server identification for security obscurity

### 6. Error Handling
- **Enhanced JWT Service**: Better exception handling and error messages
- **Secure Login**: Generic error messages to prevent user enumeration attacks

## Security Recommendations for Production

### 1. JWT Secret Key
```bash
# Generate a secure 256-bit key
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables in production:
```bash
JWT__SECRETKEY=<your-secure-random-key>
DATABASE__CONNECTIONSTRING=<your-mongodb-connection>
CORS__ALLOWEDORIGINS__0=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Additional Security Measures
- Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Add request logging and monitoring
- Consider implementing refresh tokens for better security
- Set up proper SSL/TLS certificates
- Implement account lockout policies
- Add two-factor authentication (2FA)

### 4. Monitoring & Logging
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Log security-related events
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- Implement request correlation IDs for better tracing
